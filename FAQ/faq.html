                    <summary>Can I catch Coronavirus by donating blood?</summary>
                    <p>No. Donating blood is safe. We always use new, sterile needles that are discarded after use. </p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can I donate blood while I’m sick?</summary>
                    <p>No, as always, you are not eligible to donate if you’re experiencing a cold, sore throat, respiratory infection or flu-like symptoms until three days after the symptoms have passed.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Do you test blood before it goes to recipients?</summary>
                    <p>All donated blood, even donations from repeat donors, is tested for blood type, hepatitis, HIV, syphilis, and other transfusion transmissible diseases.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can you catch Coronavirus from a blood transfusion?</summary>
                    <p>There is no evidence that coronaviruses are transmissible by blood transfusion. Furthermore, pre-donation screening procedures are designed to prevent donations from people who are experiencing symptoms of respiratory illnesses.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Will we run out of blood?</summary>
                    <p>If future blood drives are cancelled, our community’s blood supply will drop. We need to build up our reserves now so that we have enough blood available to withstand any temporary shortages and help those in need.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can I donate if I have a cold, flu or fever?</summary>
                    <p>No. To donate, you must be symptom-free from cold, flu or fever on the day of donation.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can I donate when I am under the care of a doctor or dentist? </summary>
                    <p>You may be eligible to donate, depending on your condition. Donation is acceptable after routine teeth cleaning or dental work.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can I donate if I am taking medication?</summary>
                    <p>Most medications do not prevent you from donating blood. Common medications — such as those used to control blood pressure, birth control pills and over-the-counter medications — do not affect your eligibility. If you're taking antibiotics, you must complete the course before donating.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can I donate if I have recently had a vaccination?</summary>
                    <p>Donation is acceptable after most vaccinations as long as you are feeling well. Donors vaccinated for chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella and smallpox or who have received the oral polio vaccine must wait two to four weeks after vaccination.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What should I do before I donate?</summary>
                    <p>Before donating, eat a good meal and drink plenty of fluids. This will help reduce the risk of fainting during the procedure as well.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>I'm afraid I'll faint when I see the needle or blood. Is there anything that I can do to prevent that from happening?</summary>
                    <p>It's common to be nervous about donating blood if you've never done it before. Be assured that fainting before, during or after blood donation is rare. Staff members are skilled at making the experience as smooth as possible. It may help to not watch the needle as it is inserted, and you don't have to see the blood. The Blood Donation Program offers a television, movies and access to wireless internet, which may help keep your mind occupied while you're donating.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can I donate if I recently had a tattoo or ear or body piercing?</summary>
                    <p>Donors with tattoos or ear or body piercings need to speak to staff to determine eligibility.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Does the needle hurt the entire time?</summary>
                    <p>No. There may be a little sting when the needle is inserted, but there should be no pain whatsoever during the rest of the donation.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How long will it take my body to replenish the donated blood?</summary>
                    <p>Your body replaces the blood volume (plasma) within 24 hours. Red blood cells are replaced by the bone marrow into the circulatory system within about three to four weeks, while the lost iron is replaced over approximately six to eight weeks.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can I donate during my menstrual period?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, if you are feeling well.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What is a “unit” of blood?</summary>
                    <p>A unit is about 450 ml of donated blood. The average adult has between four and five litres of blood in his or her body, and can easily spare one unit.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Is it possible to get HIV/AIDS from donating blood?</summary>
                    <p>No. You cannot get AIDS or any other infectious disease by giving blood. The materials used for your blood donation, including the needle, blood collection bag, tubes and finger prick needle are new, sterile and disposable. These are used only once for your blood donation and then destroyed after use.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Will travel abroad make me ineligible to donate?</summary>
                    <p>Travel to certain countries may prevent you from donating blood. Check with your blood center if you have questions on travel-related deferrals.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How long does it take to give blood?</summary>
                    <p>The process for whole blood donation usually takes about one hour with the collection itself usually lasting only about 10 minutes. Expect to spend about two hours for an apheresis platelet collection. The donation process includes registration, a brief medical screening, blood collection, and refreshments.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Is it safe to receive blood?</summary>
                    <p>The blood supply is safe. Blood donor eligibility standards, individual donor screening, laboratory testing, and donor record checks are in place at donor centers to help ensure the safety of blood transfusions.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How often can I give?</summary>
                    <p>You can donate whole blood every 56 days. Red blood cells will return to normal levels within approximately two weeks of donation.</p>
                    <p> You can donate platelets (apheresis donation) as much as twice in a 7- day period - or up to 24 times in a rolling 12 months. Platelet and plasma components are replaced in the body more quickly than red cells. Platelets will return to normal levels within a few hours of donating. Plasma, the liquid portion of your blood, takes a couple of days.</p>
